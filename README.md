# Fluffy-birds
[IMAGINARY] Fluffiness and temperature levels on captured birds. 

This R scripts goal is to analyzes the birds fluffiness in 
relation to the environmental temperature in the area the birds 
where captured, generating a visual graph to show a potential 
correlation. 

This datasett is just an imaginary datasett collected randomely by 
GPT-UiO (an AI chat program created by the university of Oslo). 
All reasults have no real value, and should not be used as a
actualy scientific study. This whole repository project is just
a test for using R-coding and sharing data on github - all for the
sake of learning how to do reproducible science.

If the packages dont work, try installing them first using this code: 

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("dplyr")
``` 
 

The R version used when creating the graph was R 4.5.1. The packages
used in the coding where tidyverse, readxl and dplyr. 
The coding happend between 2/10/25 - 6/10/25. 
The PC used for the coding was a Windows 11 Home laptop, 24H2 version.
